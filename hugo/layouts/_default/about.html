          <h1>About “Hello World!”</h1>
          <p>The goal of Hello World! Is to provide a learning environment for people who want to learn how to make websites and have a taste at programming  - perhaps with the idea one day of becoming professional Developers.</p>
          <p>These skills are like riding a bike: you can read many books about biking, it is only once you climb on the bike and try using it that you actually learn and improve.</p>
          <p>Likewise, the best way to learn programming is by trying. The learning material abides to this principle : it requires  you to practice by following instructions,  solving problems and searching the documentation. Through these activities, you will be learning the fundamentals of html, css and javascript.</p>
          <p>We hope you enjoy the learning experience and that you will soon be as passionate about programming and making websites as we are !</p>
